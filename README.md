# Plex Background

This is a simple script to retrieve plex media background, i developed this to use it with projectivy android tv launcher

To use the script, you have to specify your plex token and plex server url

The script retrieves the background of the latests shows (movies or tv shows)
it resizes the image, add an overlay and add text on top

How to :
- Download the content of the github and put the script and images in a specific folder
- Edit the script "script.py" to specify you plex server url and plex token, specify the number of poster to generate, specify if you want to include movies and tv, specify if you want latest added or latest aired items. You can also edit the code to change the text position or content
- As you run "python script.py" it will create a new folder called plex backgrounds and it will create the images automatically. Each time the script runs it will delete the content of the folder and create new images
