# Plex Background

This is a simple script to retrieve plex media background, i developed this to use it with projectivy android tv launcher

To use the script, you have to specify your plex token and plex server url

The script retrieves the background of the latests show (movies or tv shows)
it resizes the image, add an overlay and add text on top
